## Scanner Update

- Building iteration 2 of the scanner:
  - lighter weight
  - vacuum-formed box
  - less variability of mirror angles, camera placement, etc.
  - lower risk of capturing extra information
  
  - "Core" of scanner should work indoors and outdoors
  
- Original generation scanner should be operational again (after AAFS damage) within 2 weeks

## Scanner: Future Work

- Database set up for image downloads

- Reach out to practitioners and collaborators to set up additional data collection sites

    - Contacts from AAFS
    - Scanner at University of Nebraska Lincoln

- Work with IRB to determine whether additional oversight is necessary

## Statistical Modeling Update

- Texture Detection
    - Model fit using icevision.ai
    - Regions identified automatically and then labeled
    - Model identifies largest area of the shoe and predicts well for that region
    - Very low accuracy on smaller shoe areas
    
- Plan to fit with shapes instead of textures to debug:
    - Is texture too subtle for the network to detect?
    - Is the model just not structured well for the features we're trying to detect?
    - Model structure vs. data quality vs. implementation

- All work performed on images from Zappos website

## Statistical Modeling Future Work

#### Different Features
- Transfer over model with to shoe scanner data

- Train models on shapes, logos, distinct text, etc. 

- Project physical dimensions of shoes that could correspond to shoe size

#### Model Variations

- Data will be fit using different model variations including RetinaNet, YOLO (You Only Look Once), and VarifocalNet

- Utilize the Icevision package to extend the fastai libraryâ€™s limitations
